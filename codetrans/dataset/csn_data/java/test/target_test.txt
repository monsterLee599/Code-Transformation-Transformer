we are overriding the default paintComponent method grabbing the Graphics handle and doing our own drawing here . Esentially this method draws a large black rectangle . A drawRenderedImage is then painted doing an affine transformation on the scaled image to position it so the the desired point is in the middle of the Graphics object . The picture is not scaled here because this is a slow operation and only needs to be done once while moving the image is something the user is likely to do more often .
